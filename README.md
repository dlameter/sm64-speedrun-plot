# Visualize speedrunning data
This purpose of this project is to gain experience visualizing complex data, so I've chosen the easy to access speedrunning data found at [speedrun.com](speedrun.com).

## Data retrieval
Data is retrieved into a json format using the [srcomapi](https://github.com/blha303/srcomapi) library. The script for retrieving said data is found in the scripts directory.
